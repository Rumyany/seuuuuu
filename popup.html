                <h1 class="coffename">Espresso</h1>
                <h3 class="text">Espresso is a short, strong type of coffee prepared by forcing hot water under pressure through finely ground coffee beans. This beverage gets its name from the Italian word "espresso," which means "express" or "under pressure." Espresso is a key component in many coffee drinks, such as cappuccinos, lattes, Americanos, and more.

Here are some characteristics of espresso:

Concentrated: Espresso has a high caffeine concentration and an intense flavor. It is typically served in a small portion, usually around 30 ml (1 ounce).

Thick Crema: Properly prepared espresso has a layer of crema on top, which is a creamy, brown foam. The crema imparts a rich taste and texture to the beverage.

Quick Preparation: Espresso is made very quickly, usually in 25-30 seconds. This is achieved using an espresso machine that maintains high pressure to extract flavors from the coffee beans.

Different from Regular Coffee: Unlike regular black coffee, which is typically brewed by steeping coffee grounds in hot water, espresso is prepared by pumping water through the grounds under pressure.

Used in Various Drinks: Espresso serves as the base ingredient for various coffee beverages, such as cappuccinos, lattes, macchiatos, and more.

Espresso is a popular beverage worldwide and is considered a symbol of Italian coffee culture. Its strong flavor and energy boost make it a popular choice for many coffee enthusiasts.</h3>
