                <h1 class="coffename">Classic pancakes </h1>
                <h3 class="text">Classic pancakes, also known as buttermilk pancakes, are a beloved breakfast dish enjoyed around the world. Here's a description in English:

Classic pancakes are a timeless breakfast delight, cherished for their fluffy texture and rich, comforting flavor. These pancakes are typically made from a simple batter consisting of flour, buttermilk, eggs, sugar, baking powder, and a pinch of salt. The batter is carefully mixed to achieve the perfect balance of lightness and thickness.

When cooking classic pancakes, a griddle or skillet is heated to just the right temperature, and a small amount of butter or oil is added to prevent sticking. The batter is poured onto the cooking surface, forming round, golden circles that gradually puff up and develop a tempting golden-brown color. As they cook, the pancakes release a mouthwatering aroma that promises a delightful breakfast experience.

Served hot off the griddle, classic pancakes are often stacked high on a plate, and each layer is generously drizzled with maple syrup, which cascades down the sides. A final pat of butter may crown the top, adding a luscious richness to each bite. Some people enjoy adding a variety of toppings, such as fresh berries, sliced bananas, whipped cream, or even a sprinkle of powdered sugar, to customize their pancakes to perfection.

The joy of classic pancakes lies not only in their delightful taste but also in the warm, comforting memories they evoke. Whether enjoyed on a lazy weekend morning or as a special treat, these pancakes continue to be a breakfast classic that never goes out of style.</h3>
