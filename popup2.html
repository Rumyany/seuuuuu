                <h1 class="coffename">Latte</h1>
                <h3 class="text">A latte, short for "caffè latte" in Italian, is a popular coffee beverage known for its creamy and smooth flavor. The name "latte" means "milk" in Italian, and the drink is aptly named because it consists of espresso and steamed milk. Here is a brief description of a latte:

Ingredients: A latte is made using a shot of espresso combined with a generous amount of steamed milk. The ratio of milk to espresso can vary, but it is typically more milk than espresso.

Espresso Base: The heart of a latte is the espresso shot. Espresso is prepared by forcing hot water through finely ground coffee beans, resulting in a concentrated and robust coffee flavor.

Steamed Milk: The milk used in a latte is steamed to create a creamy, velvety texture. The steaming process also adds a slightly sweet flavor to the milk.

Frothed Milk: Some lattes are topped with frothed milk, which creates a layer of airy foam on top of the beverage. This foam can be used for decorative purposes or to enhance the overall texture.

Customization: Lattes can be customized with various flavorings, such as vanilla, caramel, or hazelnut syrup. These flavored lattes are often called "vanilla latte," "caramel latte," or "hazelnut latte," depending on the syrup used.

Variations: There are several popular variations of lattes, including iced lattes (served with ice), chai lattes (made with spiced tea concentrate and steamed milk), and mocha lattes (blending espresso with chocolate).

Presentation: Lattes are often served in tall glasses or mugs. The presentation can include latte art, which is a creative design made by pouring frothed milk into the coffee's surface.
